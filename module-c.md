# Module C - DineEase Showcase Website

### Understanding and implementing the DineEase's Vision: 

You have already created an immersive and visually appealing showcase website for DineEase dining platform in the previous round. Since you performed that task under uncontrolled conditions and in a long timeframe, management wants to test whether you can produce work of similar quality under controlled conditions and time pressure. For this reason, you will need to create a simplified version of the site, complete with a new registration page.

You should ensure that the design of all subpages is visually aligned, creating a cohesive and harmonious user experience. You should follow the provided design file as much as possible. The design files, images, and text content can be found in the `assets` folder.

### Objective
Create a simplified version of the DineEase showcase website, focusing on cohesive design and user experience across all subpages. A significant addition to this module is the implementation of a new registration page for restaurants. You must strictly adhere to the provided design files, ensuring that the visual and thematic alignment of all elements reflects DineEase's vision.

### Assets
All necessary design files, images, and text content are available in the `assets` folder. You are expected to utilize these resources to ensure fidelity to the original design specifications.
