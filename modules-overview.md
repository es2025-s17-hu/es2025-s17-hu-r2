## Introduction:

**DineEase**, a small startup based in Hungary, initially made waves in the restaurant industry with their innovative restaurant software. Now, they are expanding their horizons with a brand new service that aims to revolutionize how people discover, explore, and engage with restaurants. In the DineEase all-in-one portal visitors can choose between restaurants, view the full menu of any restaurant, read reviews from previous guests about the restaurant service and food. They can also book a table at the restaurant of their choice and order and pay through the website or the app.

You used to work as a freelance web developer, but now you've applied for a job as a developer at DineEase. The company's management wants to test your skills, so as part of the recruitment process, they asked you to develop the prototype of their new service. You have already successfully completed the first round of the recruitment process, and by creating a prototype for the DineEase showcase website, you have been selected from over 100 candidates to the second round, where only the top six candidates are left.

In this round you will have three different tasks. First you have to create a backend with several REST API endpoints to serve the DineEase front end apps, then you will develop an admin app which will be used by the DineEase staff. Your final task is to develop a new version of the showcase website.

Descriptions of the three tasks:

- [Modules A - DineEase Backend](module-a.md)
- [Modules B - DineEase Admin](module-b.md)
- [Modules C - DineEase Admin](module-c.md)

## Technical Environment

You can solve the tasks by doing the development on your own machine. For all three tasks, you can start with the selected template repo available on DineEasy Gitea.

The Gitea service is available at the following address:
[https://gitea.dineease.com](https://gitea.dineease.com)

To log in, you must use the username and password you have been given.
After logging in, create a new repo for the next task.

On the form write the name of the new repo using the following pattern: es2025-s17-hu-r2-module-a-YYYY, where YYYY is the 4-digit pin code you received.
Under the template field select the corresponding template (e.g react-ts-app).

Once the new repo is created, clone it to your own workstation inside the d:\es2025-s17-r2 folder.
